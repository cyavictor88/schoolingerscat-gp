<p id='t1'>Ok, so what is the purpose of inner product? The way I see it, the inner product of two vectors indicated how closely aligned those two vectors are, assuming the magnitudes of those two vectors are fixed. Two things to clarify here:

  1. How closely aligned two vectors are can be reisented by the angle or the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, as shown in Figure 1.
  
  2. What I mean by having fixed magnitude vectors is that if given a vector 
   and a set of vectors that have the same length as 
   but with different orientations, the greater the inner product of 
   and a vector from that set, the more closely aligned that vector is to 
   compare to other vectors in that set.
  
  Let me show you how the formula of inner product of two vectors is related to the cosine angle between the two vectors using Figure 1. In Figure 1, it shows two vectors, 
   and 
  , with 
   indicates the angle between twop vectors and 
   indicates the distance between two vectos.Ok, so what is the purpose of inner product? The way I see it, the inner product of two vectors indicated how closely aligned those two vectors are, assuming the magnitudes of those two vectors are fixed. Two things to clarify here:
